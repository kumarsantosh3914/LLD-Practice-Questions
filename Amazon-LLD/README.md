# Design Amazon - Online Shopping System

## System Requirements

Software development relies on system requirements to guide the develoment processs. These requirements give us a complete understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. There are two main types of requirements - functionals and non-functional.

Functional requirements outline the core functionality of the system. They tell us what tasks the system should perform and describe the user interactions. These requirements must be specific, measurable, and achievable.

On the other hand, non-functional requirements deal with the system's operational characteristics, such as performance, security, reliability, and usability. These requirements ensure the system performs optimally and meets the user's expectations in different situations.
