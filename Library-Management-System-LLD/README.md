# Low-Level Design of Library Management System Classes and Methods Involved

- Low-level design for a library management system in C++ would involve creating classes and functions to handle the various operations and data required for the system. 

- **_Here is an example of how the system could be designed_**

1. **Book Class:** This class would store information about a single book, such as its title, author, ISBN number, and availability status. It would also include functions to check out and return a book.

2. **Library Class:** This class would store a collection of books and handle operations such as adding and removing books, searching for books, and displaying the list of books.

3. **Patron Class:** This class would also include functions to check out and return books. names and ID numbers. It would also include functions to check out and reuturn books.

4. **Checkout Class:** This class would handle the checking out and returning of books. It would store information about which patron has checked out which book and when it is due to be returned.

5. **main() function:** This function would be responsible for crating objects of the Library, Book, Patron, and Checkout classes and calling the appropriate functions to carry out the library management tasks.
